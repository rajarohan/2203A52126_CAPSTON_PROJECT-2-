# Machine Learning Model Comparison with Uncertainty Analysis

This repository contains Python code for training and comparing different machine learning models on a dataset. The code performs the following tasks:

- Loads a dataset containing cellphone price information.
- Handles missing values by filling them with the mean of the respective columns.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using a train-test split.
- Applies data scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Trains and evaluates five different regression models:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Ridge Regression
  3. Lasso Regression
  4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

The code also performs bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty of model predictions.
